# CShell
This repository contains the implementation of a shell written in C as a way to begin 
exploring more lower-level programming concepts & getting familiar with C as a language. I had started out combing 
through the 2nd edition of Kernighan & Ritchie's [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) 
and immediately recognized the many aspects of programming I take for granted that are completely abstracted away 
from my day-to-day work when using something like Java, Python, or TypeScript.

An initial challenge in approaching C was knowing enough about programming to start working through small problems
but not having a mindset to conceptualize all the working parts. This is an area where I think Kernighan & Ritchie's
book really shines in that simple solutions are implemented and studied so one has a better understanding of the 
powerful features offered from various C libraries.

The code here started off from a wonderful [walkthrough by Stephen Brennan](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) 
that tackles the task of implementing a shell in C. My main goals in working through it were to:
1. Get familiar with the various tools available in C's standard library
2. Get a better understanding of the shell in general
3. See how someone else writes C code
